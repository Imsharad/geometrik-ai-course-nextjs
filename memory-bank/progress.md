# Project Progress Tracker

## Previous Task: Instructor Section Bug Fix & Enhancement - âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:** Debug and fix critical fs module error in instructor section component and enhance with real profile picture.

**Analysis:**
* **Problem:** Client component trying to import Node.js `fs` module causing "Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'" error
* **Root Cause:** Violation of Next.js client/server component boundaries - server-side file operations in client component
* **Impact:** Instructor page completely broken, unable to load

**Strategy:**
1. **Proper Component Architecture:**
   * Split monolithic component into server and client components
   * Server component handles YAML file reading and data processing
   * Client component handles interactivity and animations
2. **Maintain All Features:**
   * Preserve Framer Motion animations
   * Keep all interactive tabs and UI elements
   * Maintain responsive design and styling
3. **Add Real Profile Picture:**
   * Replace placeholder with actual instructor photo
   * Fine-tune image positioning for optimal display

**Implementation Progress:**
1. âœ… **Install missing dependencies:** Added @types/js-yaml for TypeScript support
2. âœ… **Create client component:** Built `instructor-client.tsx` with all interactive features
3. âœ… **Transform server component:** Converted `instructor-section.tsx` to server component for YAML processing
4. âœ… **Data pipeline:** Established proper data flow from server to client components
5. âœ… **Profile picture integration:** Added real instructor photo at `/images/instructor/main.jpeg`
6. âœ… **Image positioning optimization:** Fine-tuned object positioning (center 5%) for perfect framing
7. âœ… **Testing & verification:** Confirmed all functionality works including animations, tabs, and data display

**Technical Details:**
* **Server Component:** Handles fs.readFileSync, yaml.load, and data transformation
* **Client Component:** Manages useState, useRef, useEffect, and Framer Motion animations
* **Type Safety:** Proper TypeScript interfaces for data flow between components
* **Image Optimization:** Custom object-position styling for profile photo cropping

**Key Achievements:**
* âœ… Resolved critical build error blocking instructor page
* âœ… Implemented proper Next.js App Router architecture patterns
* âœ… Maintained all existing functionality and user experience
* âœ… Added professional instructor profile picture

## Current Major Task: Refactoring Case Study Detail Component - ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Break down the large, monolithic case study detail component into smaller, focused components for better maintainability and code organization.

**Analysis:**
* **Current State:** The detail.tsx file (816 lines) is a large monolithic component handling multiple concerns
* **Target State:** Multiple smaller components with single responsibilities in a logical directory structure
* **Benefits:** Improved code maintainability, readability, and potential for component reuse

**Strategy:**
1. **Create Directory Structure:**
   * Create a `detail` subdirectory under `src/components/case-studies/`
   * Move logical sections into individual component files
2. **Extract Core Components:**
   * Extract the Hero section
   * Extract Header/Actions section (breadcrumbs, share buttons)
   * Extract Content sections (Challenge, Solution, Outcomes, etc.)
   * Extract Sidebar components (Technologies, Timeline, Student Info)
3. **Manage Shared State/Props:**
   * Pass required data down to child components
   * Keep shared style constants and utilities accessible
4. **Preserve Animation Behavior:**
   * Maintain all Framer Motion animations during refactoring
   * Ensure client/server component boundaries are respected

**Proposed Component Structure:**
* `src/components/case-studies/detail.tsx` (Main wrapper)
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/CaseStudyHero.tsx`
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/CaseStudyHeaderActions.tsx`
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/CaseStudyContent.tsx` (Main content column)
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/KeyOutcomesSection.tsx`
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/ContentSection.tsx` (Reusable section)
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/MarkdownContent.tsx`
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/MetricsSection.tsx`
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/CtaSection.tsx`
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/CaseStudySidebar.tsx` (Sidebar wrapper)
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/TechnologiesSection.tsx`
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/TimelineSection.tsx`
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/StudentInfoSection.tsx`
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/NavigationSection.tsx`
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/SectionTitle.tsx` (Shared)
* `src/components/case-studies/detail/constants.ts` (Shared)

**Implementation Progress:**
1. [x] Create new git branch for refactoring
2. [x] Set up directory structure for new components
3. [ ] Extract shared utilities (SectionTitle, domain constants)
4. [ ] Extract Hero component
5. [ ] Extract Header/Actions components
6. [ ] Extract Sidebar components
7. [ ] Extract Content section components
8. [ ] Update main Detail component to use new components
9. [ ] Test and verify functionality matches original
10. [ ] Code review and PR

**Key Considerations:**
* Maintain "use client" directive for components using client-side features
* Ensure consistent prop passing and types
* Preserve all animations and interactive features
* Keep component styling consistent with original
* Document component responsibilities

## Previous Task: Fix for Framer Motion Error in Next.js Build - âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:** Quickly implement essential Supabase authentication with a "move fast" approach.

**Analysis:**
* **Current State:** Basic Supabase auth middleware exists but conflicts with NextJS redirects
* **MVP Focus:** Implement only the most critical authentication features
* **Philosophy:** Ship working auth quickly, iterate and enhance later

**Strategy:**
1. **Fix Config Conflicts:**
   * Remove hardcoded redirects from `next.config.mjs`
2. **Implement Core Auth Pages:**
   * Minimal login page with email/password
   * Minimal signup page with email/password
   * Simple logout button in navigation
3. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure:**
   * Use current middleware for session handling
   * Use existing profile table and DB trigger

**Implementation Progress:**
1. âœ… **Fix redirects:** Updated `next.config.mjs` to remove conflicting routes for authentication
2. âœ… **Header integration:** Updated `HeaderActions` component to use the `UserMenu` component
3. âœ… **User menu improvements:** Enhanced `UserMenu` component with better error handling and styling
4. âœ… **Login form simplification:** Streamlined login form for MVP approach, improved error handling
5. âœ… **Signup form simplification:** Streamlined signup form for MVP approach, improved validation and user feedback
6. âœ… **Test & ship:** Complete authentication flow is now functional
7. âœ… **Dashboard verification:** Confirmed dashboard page loads correctly after authentication
8. âœ… **Profile management:** Verified profile management UI works with proper fields (email, full name, avatar URL, bio)

**Key Learnings:**
* Proper middleware configuration is essential for handling auth routes and protected pages
* Client components (marked with "use client") are needed for all auth-related UI with interactive elements
* Removing OAuth temporarily for MVP approach simplified implementation
* Error handling in auth forms significantly improves user experience
* Input validation (especially for password fields) prevents common signup issues
* Profile management should be simple but complete with essential fields
* Fast feedback (loading states, success messages) keeps users informed during auth processes

**Deferred for Later:**
* Password reset flow
* Email verification
* OAuth/social login (removed from UI for MVP)
* Advanced profile management page
* Enhanced UI components
* Role-based permissions

**Completion Notes:**
* Auth redirects removed from next.config.mjs
* Login/signup forms simplified and improved error handling
* UserMenu integrated into site header with logout functionality
* Advanced validation added for signup form
* Streamlined authentication flow
* Dashboard page with welcome message and profile management
* Profile editing with fields for full name, avatar URL, and bio
* Sign Out button in profile section for easy logout

## Previous Task: Project Structure Reorganization

**Goal:** Reorganize the project structure to reduce noise in the root directory by moving code into a src directory while maintaining proper functionality.

**Analysis:**
* **Original Structure:** Multiple directories at the root level including app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, styles/, and config/
* **Target Structure:** Move code directories under src/ while keeping special directories like public/ and content/ at the root
* **Requirements:** Update import paths and tsconfig.json to ensure the application continues to function

**Strategy:**
1. **Create src directory structure:**
   * Move app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, styles/, and config/ into src/
   * Keep public/ and content/ at root level
2. **Update configuration:**
   * Modify tsconfig.json paths to point to the new structure
   * Create special path mapping for content directory
3. **Fix import references:**
   * Update any imports that might be affected by the restructuring
   * Check for special cases like styles imports

**Implementation Progress:**
1. âœ… Created src directory
2. âœ… Moved app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, styles/, and config/ into src/
3. âœ… Updated tsconfig.json paths configuration
4. âœ… Fixed import paths in layout.tsx and other files
5. âœ… Verified build and development server work correctly
6. âœ… Committed changes to the repository

**Next Steps:**
