## Current Major Task: Fix for Framer Motion Error in Next.js Build

**Goal:** Fix the build error related to React context usage in Framer Motion components during server-side rendering.

**Analysis:**
* **Problem:** Build error `TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'ReactSharedInternals.H.useContext')` occurring during the static generation of error pages (specifically `/404`).
* **Cause:** Client-side components with React hooks being incorrectly processed during server-side rendering.
* **Complication:** App Router's strict separation between Server and Client Components.

**Strategy:**
1. **Create proper client/server component boundary:**
   * Create a client component wrapper for the `FramerErrorFix` component
   * Use dynamic imports with `{ ssr: false }` in the client wrapper
   * Ensure all client-side logic is properly isolated
2. **Restore proper project build process:**
   * Clean build cache and reinstall dependencies
   * Verify build completes successfully

**Implementation Progress:**
1. ✅ Created `src/components/FramerErrorFixClient.tsx` client wrapper component
2. ✅ Used `next/dynamic` with `{ ssr: false }` option to prevent server-side rendering
3. ✅ Updated layout to use the client wrapper component
4. ✅ Cleared build cache and reinstalled dependencies
5. ✅ Successfully fixed the build error

**Next Steps:**
* Monitor for any other build errors
* Consider documenting the client/server component boundary pattern for future reference

## Previous Task: Project Structure Reorganization

**Goal:** Reorganize the project structure to reduce noise in the root directory by moving code into a src directory while maintaining proper functionality.

**Analysis:**
* **Original Structure:** Multiple directories at the root level including app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, styles/, and config/
* **Target Structure:** Move code directories under src/ while keeping special directories like public/ and content/ at the root
* **Requirements:** Update import paths and tsconfig.json to ensure the application continues to function

**Strategy:**
1. **Create src directory structure:**
   * Move app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, styles/, and config/ into src/
   * Keep public/ and content/ at root level
2. **Update configuration:**
   * Modify tsconfig.json paths to point to the new structure
   * Create special path mapping for content directory
3. **Fix import references:**
   * Update any imports that might be affected by the restructuring
   * Check for special cases like styles imports

**Implementation Progress:**
1. ✅ Created src directory
2. ✅ Moved app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, styles/, and config/ into src/
3. ✅ Updated tsconfig.json paths configuration
4. ✅ Fixed import paths in layout.tsx and other files
5. ✅ Verified build and development server work correctly
6. ✅ Committed changes to the repository

**Next Steps:**
* Continue to monitor for any issues related to the restructuring
* Consider adding documentation about the project structure

## Blockers & Challenges
- ~~Missing dependencies: 'gray-matter', 'remark', and 'remark-html' packages need to be installed for the Markdown parsing in case studies feature~~ (FIXED)
- ~~Previous npm install command failed with peer dependency conflicts~~ (RESOLVED by switching to Bun)
- ~~npm installation hanging and taking too long~~ (RESOLVED by switching to Bun)

## Recent Decisions
- Decided to use Cursor Rules to enhance AI assistance during development
- Established memory-bank structure for maintaining project context
- Decided to implement Case Studies using file-based Markdown approach rather than a CMS
- Created feature branch 'feature/case-studies' for case study implementation
- Implemented search functionality for case studies
- Used --legacy-peer-deps flag to resolve package installation conflicts with React 19
- Migrated from npm to Bun for significantly faster package installations and better dependency resolution
- Redesigned case study detail page with premium-quality design and sophisticated animations
- Implemented advanced micro-interactions for enhanced user experience

## Learning & Insights
- Next.js App Router provides better server-side rendering capabilities
- Cursor Rules can significantly enhance development workflow with AI assistance
- Framer Motion enables sophisticated animations with minimal code
- Advanced animation techniques (parallax, spring animations, scroll-triggered animations) greatly enhance UX
- When installing packages with complex peer dependencies, use '--legacy-peer-deps' flag to resolve conflicts
- Next.js 15 uses React 19, which may cause peer dependency conflicts with some packages
- Bun provides much faster package installation and better dependency resolution than npm
- Using framer-motion's useScroll, useTransform and useSpring hooks creates natural-feeling animations
- Custom section title components with animated accents create a more premium feel
