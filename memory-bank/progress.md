# Project Progress Tracker

## Completed Milestones
- [x] Initial project setup with Next.js 15.1.0
- [x] Basic directory structure established
- [x] Memory-bank and Cursor Rules infrastructure created
- [x] Designing and implementing Case Studies feature
- [x] Switched from npm to Bun for faster dependency management

## In Progress
- [ ] Implementing core UI components
- [ ] Setting up page routes and layouts
- [ ] Establishing AI assistance through Cursor Rules

## Upcoming Milestones
- [ ] Complete curriculum section implementation
- [ ] Develop instructor profiles section
- [ ] Implement pricing section
- [ ] Create FAQ section
- [ ] Enhance community features

## Implemented Features
- [x] Case study listing page with search functionality
- [x] Individual case study detail pages
- [x] Related case studies component
- [x] Markdown storage for case studies
- [x] Fixed missing dependencies for case studies (gray-matter, remark, remark-html)

## Blockers & Challenges
- ~~Missing dependencies: 'gray-matter', 'remark', and 'remark-html' packages need to be installed for the Markdown parsing in case studies feature~~ (FIXED)
- ~~Previous npm install command failed with peer dependency conflicts~~ (RESOLVED by switching to Bun)
- ~~npm installation hanging and taking too long~~ (RESOLVED by switching to Bun)

## Recent Decisions
- Decided to use Cursor Rules to enhance AI assistance during development
- Established memory-bank structure for maintaining project context
- Decided to implement Case Studies using file-based Markdown approach rather than a CMS
- Created feature branch 'feature/case-studies' for case study implementation
- Implemented search functionality for case studies
- Used --legacy-peer-deps flag to resolve package installation conflicts with React 19
- Migrated from npm to Bun for significantly faster package installations and better dependency resolution

## Learning & Insights
- Next.js App Router provides better server-side rendering capabilities
- Cursor Rules can significantly enhance development workflow with AI assistance
- Framer Motion will be used for advanced animations on Case Studies page
- When installing packages with complex peer dependencies, use '--legacy-peer-deps' flag to resolve conflicts
- Next.js 15 uses React 19, which may cause peer dependency conflicts with some packages
- Bun provides much faster package installation and better dependency resolution than npm
