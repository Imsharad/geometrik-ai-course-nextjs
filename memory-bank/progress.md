# Project Progress Tracker

## Current Major Task: Minimal Viable Auth Implementation - ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Quickly implement essential Supabase authentication with a "move fast" approach.

**Analysis:**
* **Current State:** Basic Supabase auth middleware exists but conflicts with NextJS redirects
* **MVP Focus:** Implement only the most critical authentication features
* **Philosophy:** Ship working auth quickly, iterate and enhance later

**Strategy:**
1. **Fix Config Conflicts:**
   * Remove hardcoded redirects from `next.config.mjs`
2. **Implement Core Auth Pages:**
   * Minimal login page with email/password
   * Minimal signup page with email/password
   * Simple logout button in navigation
3. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure:**
   * Use current middleware for session handling
   * Use existing profile table and DB trigger

**Implementation Progress:**
1. ✅ **Fix redirects:** Updated `next.config.mjs` to remove conflicting routes for authentication
2. ✅ **Header integration:** Updated `HeaderActions` component to use the `UserMenu` component
3. ✅ **User menu improvements:** Enhanced `UserMenu` component with better error handling and styling
4. ✅ **Login form simplification:** Streamlined login form for MVP approach, improved error handling
5. ✅ **Signup form simplification:** Streamlined signup form for MVP approach, improved validation and user feedback
6. ✅ **Test & ship:** Complete authentication flow is now functional
7. ✅ **Dashboard verification:** Confirmed dashboard page loads correctly after authentication
8. ✅ **Profile management:** Verified profile management UI works with proper fields (email, full name, avatar URL, bio)

**Key Learnings:**
* Proper middleware configuration is essential for handling auth routes and protected pages
* Client components (marked with "use client") are needed for all auth-related UI with interactive elements
* Removing OAuth temporarily for MVP approach simplified implementation
* Error handling in auth forms significantly improves user experience
* Input validation (especially for password fields) prevents common signup issues
* Profile management should be simple but complete with essential fields
* Fast feedback (loading states, success messages) keeps users informed during auth processes

**Deferred for Later:**
* Password reset flow
* Email verification
* OAuth/social login (removed from UI for MVP)
* Advanced profile management page
* Enhanced UI components
* Role-based permissions

**Completion Notes:**
* Auth redirects removed from next.config.mjs
* Login/signup forms simplified and improved error handling
* UserMenu integrated into site header with logout functionality
* Advanced validation added for signup form
* Streamlined authentication flow
* Dashboard page with welcome message and profile management
* Profile editing with fields for full name, avatar URL, and bio
* Sign Out button in profile section for easy logout

## Previous Task: Project Structure Reorganization

**Goal:** Reorganize the project structure to reduce noise in the root directory by moving code into a src directory while maintaining proper functionality.

**Analysis:**
* **Original Structure:** Multiple directories at the root level including app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, styles/, and config/
* **Target Structure:** Move code directories under src/ while keeping special directories like public/ and content/ at the root
* **Requirements:** Update import paths and tsconfig.json to ensure the application continues to function

**Strategy:**
1. **Create src directory structure:**
   * Move app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, styles/, and config/ into src/
   * Keep public/ and content/ at root level
2. **Update configuration:**
   * Modify tsconfig.json paths to point to the new structure
   * Create special path mapping for content directory
3. **Fix import references:**
   * Update any imports that might be affected by the restructuring
   * Check for special cases like styles imports

**Implementation Progress:**
1. ✅ Created src directory
2. ✅ Moved app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, styles/, and config/ into src/
3. ✅ Updated tsconfig.json paths configuration
4. ✅ Fixed import paths in layout.tsx and other files
5. ✅ Verified build and development server work correctly
6. ✅ Committed changes to the repository

**Next Steps:**
* Continue to monitor for any issues related to the restructuring
* Consider adding documentation about the project structure

- ~~Previous npm install command failed with peer dependency conflicts~~ (RESOLVED by switching to Bun)
- ~~npm installation hanging and taking too long~~ (RESOLVED by switching to Bun)

## Recent Decisions
- Decided to use Cursor Rules to enhance AI assistance during development
- Established memory-bank structure for maintaining project context
- Decided to implement Case Studies using file-based Markdown approach rather than a CMS
- Created feature branch 'feature/case-studies' for case study implementation
- Implemented search functionality for case studies
- Used --legacy-peer-deps flag to resolve package installation conflicts with React 19
- Migrated from npm to Bun for significantly faster package installations and better dependency resolution
- Redesigned case study detail page with premium-quality design and sophisticated animations
- Implemented advanced micro-interactions for enhanced user experience
- Created 'supabase' branch for authentication and user profile features
- Integrated Supabase for authentication, user profiles, and database with Row Level Security
- Added protected routes for authenticated users only

## Learning & Insights
- Next.js App Router provides better server-side rendering capabilities
- Cursor Rules can significantly enhance development workflow with AI assistance
- Framer Motion enables sophisticated animations with minimal code
- Advanced animation techniques (parallax, spring animations, scroll-triggered animations) greatly enhance UX
- When installing packages with complex peer dependencies, use '--legacy-peer-deps' flag to resolve conflicts
- Next.js 15 uses React 19, which may cause peer dependency conflicts with some packages
- Bun provides much faster package installation and better dependency resolution than npm
- Using framer-motion's useScroll, useTransform and useSpring hooks creates natural-feeling animations
- Custom section title components with animated accents create a more premium feel
