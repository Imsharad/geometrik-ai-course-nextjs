## Next Steps
- Implement more case study content
- Add keyboard navigation support for animated elements
- Consider performance optimizations for animation-heavy pages
- Create case study author profile pages
- Consider adding a featured case studies section to homepage
- Implement filtering/sorting functionality for case studies
- Add pagination to case studies listing
- Implement full-text search for case studies

## Notes & Considerations
- Ensure rules follow the appropriate .mdc format
- Update this file regularly to reflect current development focus
- Maintain consistent design language between case studies and existing pages
- Balance animation richness with performance considerations
- Ensure all animations have appropriate reduced-motion alternatives
- Test animations across different devices and browsers
- Use Bun instead of npm for package management to avoid dependency conflicts and for faster installations
- Test new features thoroughly across different viewport sizes
- Use the PlaceholderImage component for any future image fallbacks

## Animation Components
- `components/animations/parallax.tsx`: Parallax effect for images and backgrounds
- `components/animations/scroll-trigger.tsx`: Animations triggered by scroll position
- `lib/animations.ts`: Utility functions for animations

## Implementation Notes
- Animations should be performant and not cause layout shifts
- Focus on subtle, professional animations that enhance UX
- Ensure all animations can be disabled for accessibility
- Use dynamic placeholder images when actual images aren't available
- Maintain consistent styling between components
