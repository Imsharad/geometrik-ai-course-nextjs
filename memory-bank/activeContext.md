# Active Development Context
*Last Updated: May 2024*

## Current Focus
✅ **JUST COMPLETED:** Fixed critical Instructor Section bug - resolved fs module error by implementing proper Next.js client/server component architecture. Added real instructor profile picture with optimized positioning. The instructor page is now fully functional with dynamic YAML data loading and all interactive features working.

✅ Previously completed the MVP implementation of Supabase authentication for the Geometrik AI Course platform. The authentication system is now fully functional with login, signup, profile management, and protected routes.

### Authentication Implementation Verified:
1. **Fixed Configuration Conflict**
   - Removed hardcoded auth redirects from `next.config.mjs`
   - Ensured middleware handles auth routes correctly

2. **Simplified Login Experience**
   - Streamlined email/password login form
   - Improved error handling and feedback
   - Enhanced validation for better user experience

3. **Simplified Signup Flow**
   - Streamlined email/password signup form
   - Improved validation and error feedback
   - Added success messaging and redirect upon signup

4. **User Menu & Logout**
   - Integrated user menu into the site header
   - Added clear logout button with styling
   - Improved loading and error state handling

5. **Dashboard & Profile Management**
   - Dashboard page with welcome message and getting started section
   - Profile management with editable fields (full name, avatar URL, bio)
   - Email display (non-editable) to confirm account identity
   - Sign Out button directly on profile management panel

### Key Implementation Notes:
- Removed GitHub OAuth login for MVP to simplify the implementation
- Enhanced validation for signup form (password length requirements)
- Improved error messaging for common authentication issues
- Added clear success messaging for better user experience
- Integrated user menu with avatar and profile details
- Ensured proper middleware redirects for protected routes
- Session persistence works correctly with Supabase cookies
- Profile data is properly stored and retrieved from Supabase database

### Future Authentication Enhancements:
- Password reset flow
- Email verification
- OAuth/social login
- Advanced profile management
- Enhanced UI components
- Role-based permissions

## Next Development Focus
Planning to enhance the dashboard with course progress tracking, enrollment functionality, and content access. Key areas include:
- Course enrollment system
- Progress tracking for enrolled courses
- Content access controls based on enrollment status
- Enhanced dashboard UI with course cards
- Instructor and admin functionalities

## Previous Focus
Implemented a lean, MVP-style Supabase authentication system for the Geometrik AI Course platform, taking a "move fast" approach to quickly add essential authentication features while deferring advanced functionality for future iterations.

## Key Files in Current Focus
**Recently Completed:**
- `src/components/sections/instructor-section.tsx`: Server component handling YAML data loading
- `src/components/sections/instructor-client.tsx`: Client component with animations and interactivity
- `src/app/instructor/page.tsx`: Instructor page layout

- Create instructor dashboard for content management
- Develop admin panel for site administration
- Improve profile management with image upload
- Consider reintroducing OAuth providers for social login

## Notes & Considerations
- React 19 and Next.js 15 have stricter boundaries between server and client components
- The `"use client"` directive is required for any component using client-side React features
- For components using browser-only features, consider using dynamic imports with `ssr: false`
- Build cache issues can sometimes cause persistent errors - clear cache when troubleshooting
- The content/ directory intentionally remains at the root level for easier content management
- Using src/ directory follows modern Next.js project organization practices
- Path mappings in tsconfig.json ensure imports continue to work correctly
- Ensure all new files are created in the appropriate src/ subdirectories
- Update this file regularly to reflect current development focus
- Maintain consistent design language between case studies and existing pages
- Balance animation richness with performance considerations
- Test new features thoroughly across different viewport sizes
- Implement proper error handling for auth-related operations
- Use Row Level Security to protect user data in Supabase
- Ensure client and server components are correctly separated
