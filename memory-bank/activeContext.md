# Active Development Context
*Last Updated: Current Date*

## Current Focus
Implemented Case Studies feature with listing page, detail views, and related case studies. Fixed dependencies issue by switching to Bun package manager for faster installations and better dependency resolution.

## Active Tasks
- [x] Create memory-bank directory structure
- [x] Create .cursor/rules directory structure
- [ ] Implement core Cursor rules for project guidance
- [ ] Configure AI assistant behavior for the codebase
- [x] Create Case Studies page with modern design and animations
- [x] Set up Markdown-based case study content structure
- [x] Implement case study detail view
- [x] Fix dependencies for markdown parsing
- [x] Switch to Bun for package management

## Key Files in Current Focus
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`: Rules for AI assistant behavior
- `memory-bank/*.md`: Knowledge base for project context
- `app/case-studies/page.tsx`: Main case studies listing page (implemented)
- `app/case-studies/[slug]/page.tsx`: Individual case study template (implemented)
- `components/case-studies/*.tsx`: Case study components (implemented)
- `content/case-studies/*.md`: Case study content files (sample content created)
- `lib/case-studies.ts`: Logic for fetching and parsing case studies
- `package.json`: Project dependencies (now managed with Bun)

## Recent Changes
- Initial setup of memory-bank and .cursor/rules directories
- Documentation of project structure and technology stack
- Added new Case Studies feature request to the project scope
- Implemented complete Case Studies feature
- Created feature branch 'feature/case-studies'
- Fixed missing dependencies issues by switching to Bun
- Added search functionality to case studies listing
- Added related case studies component to detail pages
- Migrated from npm to Bun for package management

## Next Steps
- Implement more case study content
- Add additional filtering options for case studies
- Enhance animations and transitions using Framer Motion
- Consider adding categories or tags to case studies
- Create case study author profile pages

## Notes & Considerations
- Ensure rules follow the appropriate .mdc format
- Update this file regularly to reflect current development focus
- Maintain consistent design language between case studies and existing pages
- Utilize Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions
- Use Bun instead of npm for package management to avoid dependency conflicts and for faster installations
- Test new features thoroughly across different viewport sizes
