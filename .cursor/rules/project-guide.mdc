  - Each hook in a separate file
  - Clear naming with `use` prefix

- `/styles`: Global CSS and styling utilities
  - `globals.css`: Global styles
  - Other style-related configurations

- `/public`: Static assets like images, fonts, etc.

- `/memory-bank`: Project knowledge base (reference only, not part of the app)
