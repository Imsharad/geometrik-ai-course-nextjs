- Follow established project patterns for component structure
- For Case Studies feature, implement Markdown processing using gray-matter and remark/rehype

## Suggested Assistance
- Help implement file system-based data fetching for Markdown files
- Suggest appropriate animation patterns using Framer Motion
- Assist with responsive design implementation for all viewports
- Provide guidance on accessible component design
- Help with TypeScript type definitions for Markdown frontmatter data

## Resource Suggestions
- Framer Motion documentation for animation implementation
- Next.js documentation for file-based routing and static generation
- Tailwind CSS patterns for responsive design
- Markdown processing with remark/rehype ecosystem

This rule provides guidance for the AI assistant's behavior when working with this project, with special attention to the Case Studies feature implementation.
