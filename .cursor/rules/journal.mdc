# Development Journal

This rule acts as a journal of important implementation details, decisions, and notes specific to this project.

## Project Setup Notes

- Next.js 15.1.0 with App Router was chosen for its strong server-side rendering capabilities
- React 19 is used for the latest features and performance improvements
- TypeScript provides type safety throughout the codebase
- Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling
- Radix UI components provide accessible UI primitives

## Implementation Details

### Component Library

- Using a mix of Radix UI primitives and custom components
- Components are styled with Tailwind CSS using the `cn` utility
- Class-variance-authority is used for component variants

### Styling System

- Tailwind CSS with custom configuration in [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts)
- Dark mode support via next-themes
- Custom color scheme defined in the tailwind config

### Routing Structure

- App Router with nested routes for different sections
- Layout components for shared UI elements
- Server components for data fetching where possible

## Known Workarounds

- Framer Motion alpha version (12.0.0-alpha.0) is used with specific configuration in [app/fix-framer-motion.tsx](mdc:app/fix-framer-motion.tsx)
- See [app/fix-framer-errors-client.tsx](mdc:app/fix-framer-errors-client.tsx) for client-side fixes

## Future Enhancements

- Implement authentication system
- Add data fetching layer (likely with SWR or React Query)
- Enhance SEO with metadata
- Implement analytics
